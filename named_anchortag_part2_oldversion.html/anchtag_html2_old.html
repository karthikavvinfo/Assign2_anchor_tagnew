        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the markup language used to create web pages. It is the most common 
            language used to display content on the web. Whether you realize it or not, you are probably using HTML every 
            day. HTML can be used to display text, images, animations, sound and even video. HTML is made up of tags, which 
            are surrounded by angle brackets. Tags are used to describe a certain piece of information.</p>

        <h3>Answer 3</h3>
        <p>HTML and CSS work together to build webpages. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the structural code behind 
            most webpages. HTML is what creates the layout of the webpage, and creates the various headers, footers, text, 
            and images you see when you view a page. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is applied on top of the HTML and allows 
            you to modify the look and feel of the HTML structure. It's important to note that when you edit the HTML, you 
            can't see the changes in the CSS due to the separation, but you will see the changes if you view the page in a 
            different browser.</p>
